Salt Student Overview

Salt Student Overview is a web application that shows the current progress of the logged in Salt Student. It for example displays the current test progress, showing the amount of reds and greens the students has received and the feedback for each individual test. Another feature would be a page that shows all the lectures by date so that it is easier for the students to look up the lectures. A third feature could be adding the google calendar of the specific user, and highlight their planning of the day.

Tech stack:

Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js / Express
Database: PostgresSQL
Google calendar Api, for adding the students calendar with the lecture times and google meet links etc.
